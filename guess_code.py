"""
File: guess.py
Guessing a random number between the range of 1-100.
After each incorrect guess, ask user if they want a hint, if so..show hint.
MB -
Changed logic order so if 5th guess is correct it shows correctly
    did this by keeping the while count less than or equal to max guesses
    Then moving the if count to after the check for correct and making it greater than or equal
    to max guesses.
Added entry validation so won't error if a non number entered as a guess.
Also added remaining guesses after incorrect guess
This is the original code and left for reference
